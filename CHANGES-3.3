This is the changelog for Calamares. For each release, the major changes and
contributors are listed. Note that Calamares does not have a historical
changelog -- this log starts with version 3.3.0. See CHANGES-3.2 for
the history of the 3.2 series (2018-05 - 2021-12).

# 3.3.0 (unreleased) #

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Anubhav Choudhary
 - Evan James
 - Vitor Lopes

This is a "minor" version change, but the size of the changes is very
large. Configuration files from previous versions of Calamares will
**certainly** need to be re-validated. Take heed of the many changes
in the *Modules* heading, below.

## Project ##
 - The C++ code in the project is now formatted with clang-format 12 or 13,
   with the coding-style as found in `.clang-format`; there are minor
   differences from the tool, compared to the clang-format 9 usually applied
   to Calamares 3.2.
 - The CMake code in the project is now formatted with gersemi 0.7.5.

## Core ##
 - CMake 3.16, Qt 5.15 are now required; the newer CMake is to support
   new features (also for KDE Frameworks), Qt is the current LTS version.
 - KDE Framework "DBusAddons" is now required, and is used to "activate"
   Calamares; the KDAB Single Application Guard is no longer used.
   KDSAG needed patching to chase Qt 5.15 deprecations, and the DBus
   activation code is tried and tested in Frameworks (tier 1).
   Running `calamares -d` no longer enforces a single-application
   (it is for debugging purposes, after all).
 - Python 3.6 or later is now required, to allow for F-strings in
   Python code and allow other tidy-ups in the Python modules.
   Boost::Python now requires 1.67 or later (for CMake support).
 - The log file now **always** contains a debug-log, and the `-D` flag
   primarily controls what is printed to stdout. By default, stdout
   only gets errors; use `-D6` to match stdout with the file. Use `-D8`
   to get a verbose log file **and** verbose stdout.

## Modules ##
 - *bootloader* now supports more options when building the kernel
   command-line. (Thanks Evan)
 - *displaymanager* no longer supports the discontinued *kdm* display manager.
 - *grubcfg* changed the key *keepDistributor* to *keep_distributor*.
   Please update configurations.
 - *partition* requires KPMCore 21.12 (e.g. KPMCore 4.2 API, or later).
 - *partition* can now skip installing the bootloader in more scenarios.
   #1632 (Thanks Anubhav)
