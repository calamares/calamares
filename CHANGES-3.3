This is the changelog for Calamares. For each release, the major changes and

changelog -- this log starts with version 3.3.0. See CHANGES-3.2 for

# 3.3.0 (unreleased) #

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Evan James
 - Vitor Lopes

This is a "minor" version change, but the size of the changes is very
large. Configuration files from previous versions of Calamares will
**certainly** need to be re-validated. Take heed of the many changes
in the *Modules* heading, below.

## Core ##
 - CMake 3.16, Qt 5.15 are now required; the newer CMake is to support
   new features (also for KDE Frameworks), Qt is the current LTS version.
 - KDE Framework "DBusAddons" is now required, and is used to "activate"
   Calamares; the KDAB Single Application Guard is no longer used.
   KDSAG needed patching to chase Qt 5.15 deprecations, and the DBus
   activation code is tried and tested in Frameworks (tier 1).
   Running `calamares -d` no longer enforces a single-application
   (it is for debugging purposes, after all).
 - Python 3.6 or later is now required, to allow for F-strings in
   Python code and allow other tidy-ups in the Python modules.
   Boost::Python now requires 1.67 or later (for CMake support).

## Modules ##
 - *grubcfg* changed the key *keepDistributor* to *keep_distributor*.
   Please update configurations.
 - *bootloader* now supports more options when building the kernel
   command-line. (Thanks Evan)
