This is the changelog for Calamares. For each release, the major changes and
contributors are listed. Note that Calamares does not have a historical
changelog -- this log starts with version 3.2.0. The release notes on the
website will have to do for older versions.

= 3.2.2 (unreleased) =

== Core ==

 * Contributions from the following people (alphabetically by first name):
   - artoo@cromnix.org
   - Caio Carvalho
 * Example configurations are **no longer installed** by default.
   The default setting for *INSTALL_CONFIG* has changed. Distributions
   are strongly encouraged to write their own configuration files and
   not rely on the example configuration files. Example configurations
   may change unpredictably.
 * It is now possible to express module dependencies through the
   *requiredModules* key in `module.desc`. All of the required modules
   for a given module must occur in the sequence **before** the module
   requiring them. None of the core modules use this facility.
 * The search paths for QML files, branding descriptors and module
   descriptors have been revamped and now self-document in the log.
 * A new `ci/RELEASE.sh` script has been added to streamline releases;
   it is not guaranteed to work anywhere in particular though.

== Modules ==

 * When multiple modules are mutually exclusive, or don't make sense
   to enable concurrectly, a new `USE_<foo>` framework has been added
   to CMake to simplify the selection of modules. This is in addition
   to the existing `SKIP_MODULES` mechanism.
 * A new module has been added to the core which can configure openrc
   services. To make services configuration consistent:
   - The *services* module has been **renamed** *services-systemd*,
   - The openrc module is named *services-openrc*,
   - At CMake time, it is possible to select all of the services modules,
     or one specific one, by setting the *USE_services* CMake variable.
     By default, all of the modules are built and installed.
 * The systemd-services module can now disable targets and mask both
   targets and services (which will allow you to break the system with
   a bad configuration). The configuration is a little more flexible
   because a service (or target) name can be used on its own with
   sensible defaults.
