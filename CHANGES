This is the changelog for Calamares. For each release, the major changes and
contributors are listed. Note that Calamares does not have a historical
changelog -- this log starts with version 3.2.0. The release notes on the
website will have to do for older versions.

# 3.2.10 (unreleased) #

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):

## Core ##

 - With this release, option *WITH_PYTHONQT* changes default to **off**.
   There does not seem to be any serious use of the PythonQt API and
   the UI opportunities it offers, so begin the process of deprecating
   and removing that. Sometime in the future, QML pages will fill the
   gap for easily-prototyped-yet-slick UI elements.
 - A crash when no *finished* page (or rather, no page at all) is
   configured after the last *exec* section of the sequence has been
   solved. The *finished* page can be left out (but then you don't get
   the restart-now functionality).

# 3.2.9 (2019-06-03) #

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Kevin Kofler

## Core ##

No user- or deployer-visible changes. Bugfixing as usual, see the
milestone for details.

## Modules ##

 - *branding* now supports os-release variables in the *strings* section,
   which allows re-using (at runtime) information set in /etc/os-release .
   This requires KDE Frameworks 5.58. #1150
 - *branding* allows the use of FreeDesktop.org icon names for the
   *productLogo* and *productIcon* keys. If a file is named there, then
   the file is used, and otherwise the icon is looked up in the current
   theme. #1160
 - *packages* On Arch, with the `pacman` package manager, avoid a hang
   during system update. #1154
 - *welcome* allows a custom image path or icon name to be set for the
   language-selection drop-down (instead of the international standard one).


# 3.2.8 (2019-05-10) #

This is a **source-incompatible** release of Calamares. Include files
have been shuffled around, so third-party C++ modules will need
adjustment to the changed names.

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Arnaud Ferraris
 - Kevin Kofler

## Core ##

 - All user-visible texts referring to "MB" and "GB" now use the standard
   "MiB" and "GiB" wording, which matches what we were actually calculating
   with (i.e. 2^20 and 2^30 respectively). #1129
 - The side-pane, which shows the list of steps that will be executed,
   now tries to fit the text (name of each module) into the available space
   by shrinking the font as needed. #1137
 - *libcalamares* (accidentally) linked with Qt's GUI libraries when
   PythonQt was found. This led to the odd situation where the non-GUI
   Calamares library depends on a bunch of GUI libraries.
 - *libcalamares* The `utils/` subdirectory has been hugely refactored,
   with functionality split out into separate files. C++ modules will
   need to have their `#include` names updated. Basically, users of
   `utils/CalamaresUtils.h` will need to include the header file for
   the functionality that is actually used.

## Modules ##

 - *finished* has a new mechanism for configuring the behavior of the
   *restart now* button. The old-style boolean configuration is still
   supported but generates a warning. #1138
 - *locale* module GeoIP configuration has a new preferred format.
   See `locale.conf` for details. The old configuration is still
   supported but will be phased out before 3.3.0 -- in particular,
   support for "legacy" format will be removed, since that was a
   crutch for the disappearance of one GeoIP provider in 2018.
 - *oemid* is a new module for configuring OEM phase-0 (image pre-mastering,
   or pre-deployment) things. It has limited functionality at the moment,
   writing only a single batch-identifier file. #943
 - *welcome* can now do GeoIP lookups as well (but be careful with the
   configuration, since you need a GeoIP that provides country information,
   not just timezones). This will let Calamares select a starting language
   that matches where it is -- which might not be useful at all. #934
 - All Python modules now bail out gracefully on (at least some) bad
   configurations, rather than raising an exception. The pre-release
   scripts now test for exceptions to avoid shipping modules with
   ImportError or SyntaxError results.


# 3.2.7 (2019-04-27) #

This is a **hotfix** release for regressions introduced in the
Python modules. The *localecfg* module was unusable because of
a missing `import`.


# 3.2.6 (2019-04-25) #

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Arnaud Ferraris
 - Dominic Hayes (feren)
 - Raul Rodrigo Segura (raurodse)

## Core ##

 * Under-the-hood code cleanups in lots of parts of the core. Calamares now
   builds without warnings when Clang 8 is used.
 * A new *disable-cancel-during-exec* setting provides more fine-grained
   control than *disable-cancel*, which hides the button entirely.
   #1122 (Thanks to Dominic, FerenOS)
 * A branding module can now also cause a stylesheet to be loaded, which
   will be applied to the widgets inside Calamares. #961 (Thanks to Raul)

## Modules ##

 * All of the Python-based modules now have translations enabled. #991
 * *Displaymanager* module has improved support for LightDM configuration.
   #1123 (Thanks to Dominic, FerenOS)
 * *License* module can now display local files inline, and scrolls to
   allow longer lists of licenses and to support long license texts
   displayed inline. #1124 #1125 #1052
 * *Partition* module has additional checks for validity partition layouts.
   #1127 (Thanks to Arnaud)
 * *Welcome* module has improved usability: a standard icon
   alongside the *Language* label, for improved recognition,
   and improved language-list display and sorting. #1107


# 3.2.5 (2019-04-15) #

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Arnaud Ferraris
 - Dan Simmons
 - Gabriel Craciunescu

## Core ##

 * View modules (in C++) can now perform their own requirements-checking
   to see if installation makes sense. This expands upon the existing
   requirements checks in the welcome module (RAM, disk space, ..).
   The checks have been made asynchronous, so that responsiveness during
   requirements-checking is improved and the user has better feedback.
 * Support for building an AppImage of Calamares has been added to the
   `ci/` directory. There are use-cases where a containerized build and
   configuration make sense rather than having Calamares installed in the
   host system. (Thanks to the AppImage team, Alexis)
 * OEM mode (phase-1) now correctly refers to Calamares as a "Setup Program"
   rather than an installer. #1100 (Thanks to Arnaud)

## Modules ##

 * *Bootloader* module: a serious bug introduced in 3.2.4 which prevents
   succesful boot after installation on EFI machines, has been repaired.
   (Thanks to Gabriel) #1104
 * *Displaymanager* module: it is no longer a fatal error to not have any
   display-managers. #1095
 * *Partition* module: it is now possible to build without libparted. Since
   KPMCore may not need this library anymore, it is a dependency that will
   be dropped as soon as it is feasible. Add this to the CMake flags:
   `-DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_LIBPARTED=ON`
 * *Partition* module: the location that is selected for the bootloader,
   no longer changes when a new partition is created. #1098
 * Python modules: several modules have had translations added. This is
   usually only visible when the module runs as part of the *exec* step,
   when the module's *pretty name* is displayed. In addition, some error
   messages are now translated.
 * *UnpackFS* module: improved progress reporting and tests. #565


# 3.2.4 (2019-02-12) #

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Alf Gaida
 - aliveafter1000
 - Arnaud Ferraris
 - Caio Jordão Carvalho
 - Collabora LTD
 - Gabriel Craciunescu
 - Kevin Kofler

## Core ##

 * The Calamares application now recognizes the `-X` or `--xdg-config`
   option, which adds XDG_DATA_DIRS to the places used to find QML
   and branding directories, and XDG_CONFIG_DIRS to the places used
   to find the global settings and module configurations. This allows
   a more fine-grained, and more layered, approach to setting up
   Calamares configurations (in particular, distro's can **add**
   configuration files and give them priority, instead of **forking**
   configuration files).
 * The *branding* file now contains settings that control the size
   and resize behavior of Calamares. See the branding file for
   more documentation. In particular, the setting *windowExpanding*
   can be set to *normal*, *fullscreen* or *noexpand*.
 * The `settings.conf` file can now configure whether the *Cancel* button
   is shown (this isn't a branding thing, because it's quite fundamental
   to the workflow of the installer).

## Modules ##

 * The *partition* module supports RAID devices, but only when Calamares
   is compiled with the newest KPMCore release (3.3.0).
 * The calculation of required space -- including swap -- has been simplified,
   and Calamares no longer reserves 2GiB of space in calculations for internal
   use (this means that it no longer mysteriously drops swap when the disk
   size is close to the required installation size).
 * The name of the type of default filesystem (e.g. ext4 or btrfs) is now handled
   case- and localization-insensitively. This means that *btrfs* is now always
   an acceptable spelling.
 * The currently-selected disk device is remembered between manual partitioning
   and the partitioning-overview pages. (Thanks to Arnaud)
 * *partition* There is new support for partitioning layout presets.
   See `partition.conf` for documentation and details.
 * The *keyboard* module now handles the (bogus) Austrian keymap for
   the system console properly. (Thanks to Kevin)
 * The *preservefiles* module now has a mechanism for setting the permissions
   (and ownership) of preserved files. (Thanks to Scott)
 * New module *fsresizer* can be used to resize filesystems. It is intended
   for use in OEM installs where an image of fixed size is created,
   and then sized to the actual SD card the user has used.
 * The *mount* module now handles missing *extraMounts* and *extraMountsEfi*
   keys gracefully (this is probably a misconfiguration, though, and gives a
   warning).
 * The *packages* module now supports pre- and post-script options
   for all operations, not just during install (keep in mind that
   these run as three separate shells, though).
 * A new *rawfs* module supports straightforward copying of filesystems from
   the installation media to the target stystem. This can be used, for instance,
   for block-level-identical installations.


# 3.2.3 (2019-01-09) #

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - aliveafter1000

## Core ##

There are no core changes in this release.

## Modules ##

 * *partition* Fixed bug where, during detection of existing systems, the
   existing system partitions may be mounted and then files deleted.
   This is a **limited** version of the patch from aliveafter1000
   that will be in 3.2.4, which tries harder to mount filesystems
   read-only and unmodifiable.
 * *locale* It was possible to set the installer and system language
   (e.g. to German) while the global storage value for *locale*
   remained set to English. Then no localization packages are installed
   (see feature `${LOCALE}` in `packages.conf`). Reported downstream
   in Netrunner.

## Core ##

 * Example configurations are **no longer installed** by default.
   The default setting for *INSTALL_CONFIG* has changed. Distributions
   are strongly encouraged to write their own configuration files and
   not rely on the example configuration files. Example configurations
   may change unpredictably.
 * It is now possible to express module dependencies through the
   *requiredModules* key in `module.desc`. All of the required modules
   for a given module must occur in the sequence **before** the module
   requiring them. None of the core modules use this facility.
 * The search paths for QML files, branding descriptors and module
   descriptors have been revamped and now self-document in the log.
 * A new `ci/RELEASE.sh` script has been added to streamline releases;
   it is not guaranteed to work anywhere in particular though.

## Modules ##

 * When multiple modules are mutually exclusive, or don't make sense
   to enable concurrectly, a new `USE_<foo>` framework has been added
   to CMake to simplify the selection of modules. This is in addition
   to the existing `SKIP_MODULES` mechanism.
 * Various off-by-one-sector errors in the automatic partitioning
   mode have been corrected. In addition, swap space is calculated
   a little more conservatively.
 * A new module has been added to the core which can configure openrc
   services. To make services configuration consistent:
   - The *services* module has been **renamed** *services-systemd*,
   - The openrc module is named *services-openrc*,
   - At CMake time, it is possible to select all of the services modules,
     or one specific one, by setting the *USE_services* CMake variable.
     By default, all of the modules are built and installed.
 * The systemd-services module can now disable targets and mask both
   targets and services (which will allow you to break the system with
   a bad configuration). The configuration is a little more flexible
   because a service (or target) name can be used on its own with
   sensible defaults.
 * The displaymanager module has been entirely revamped. A long-standing
   bug which ignored the settings for default desktop has been fixed
   (thanks to Walter Lapchynski). Translations have been added to the
   error messages. Each DM now has an implementation class for doing
   all the configuration steps it needs. This groups the code needed for
   a specific DM (and presumably, per-distro) in one place.
   Distro's are **strongly advised** to re-test their DM configuration
   and installation with the revamped code.

# 3.2.1 (2018-06-25) #

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):

 - Gabriel Craciunescu

 - Raul Rodrigo Segura

## Core ##

 * Qt 5.7 is now the minimum required Qt version. Because KPMCore
   (a fairly fundamental dependency) requires Qt 5.7, Calamares
   has followed suit.
 * New testing application `loadmodule` for loading and running a
   single Calamares module.
 * New translations Belarussian and Korean.
 * Jobs can now be *emergency jobs* which run even after a failure.
 * Improved debugging when modules fail to load.
 * Bad configuration files will now cause the user-interface of
   Calamares to display an error message, rather than silently
   ignoring some configuration errors. This will certainly cause
   problems for distributions with sloppy configurations.

## Modules ##

 * New module preservefiles, keeps (log) files around after install;
   this duplicates functionality with the unmount module, but unmount
   is very late, rather limited, and fragile.
 * Interactiveterminal module now disables itself if build requirements
   are not met, rather than blocking the build.
 * Fixes in the timezone map data make the southern hemisphere more
   usable and put Reykjavik in its place.
 * The packages module can now update the target system if explicitly
   told to do so.
 * More paths and executables are configurable in the bootloader module.
 * Distributions are advised to review the `users.conf` setup **again**,
   as some changes in version 3.2.0 caused regressions downstream.
 * Distributions are advised to review their `locale.gen` files
   **again**. Previous changes were too restrictive, matching only
   the specific format Chakra Linux uses. Calamares now preserves
   all the comment-lines in the file and writes enabled locales
   at the end, with a descriptive comment.

## Modules ##

 * UI annoyances in the partitioning module were fixed; the
   mount-point selector is now more obvious when no mount-point
   has been chosen, and the mount-point and flags are preserved
   when (re)editing partitions.
 * The handling of `@@ROOT@@` substitution in shellprocesses was
   backwards; this has been fixed (the substitution is made when
   running in the **host**).
 * The user shell is no longer hard-coded to `/bin/bash`,
   but follows the default setting for useradd(8), e.g.
   those set in `/etc/default/useradd`.
