This is the changelog for Calamares. For each release, the major changes and
contributors are listed. Note that Calamares does not have a historical
changelog -- this log starts with version 3.2.0. The release notes on the
website will have to do for older versions.

# 3.2.5 (unreleased) #

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Arnaud Ferraris
 - Dan Simmons
 - Gabriel Craciunescu

## Core ##

 * View modules (in C++) can now perform their own requirements-checking
   to see if installation makes sense. This expands upon the existing
   requirements checks in the welcome module (RAM, disk space, ..).
   The checks have been made asynchronous, so that responsiveness during
   requirements-checking is improved and the user has better feedback.

## Modules ##

 * *Bootloader* module: a serious bug introduced in 3.2.4 which prevents
   succesful boot after installation on EFI machines, has been repaired.
   (Thanks to Gabriel)
 * *Partition* module: it is now possible to build without libparted. Since
   KPMCore may not need this library anymore, it is a dependency that will
   be dropped as soon as it is feasible. Add `-DCMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_LIBPARTED=ON`
   to the CMake flags to do so.
 * Python modules: several modules have had translations added. This is
   usually only visible when the module runs as part of the *exec* step,
   when the module's *pretty name* is displayed. In addition, error
   messages are now translated.


# 3.2.4 (2019-02-12) #

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - Alf Gaida
 - aliveafter1000
 - Arnaud Ferraris
 - Caio Carvalho
 - Collabora LTD
 - Gabriel Craciunescu
 - Kevin Kofler
 - Philip Mueller

## Core ##

 * The Calamares application now recognizes the `-X` or `--xdg-config`
   option, which adds XDG_DATA_DIRS to the places used to find QML
   and branding directories, and XDG_CONFIG_DIRS to the places used
   to find the global settings and module configurations. This allows
   a more fine-grained, and more layered, approach to setting up
   Calamares configurations (in particular, distro's can **add**
   configuration files and give them priority, instead of **forking**
   configuration files).
 * The *branding* file now contains settings that control the size
   and resize behavior of Calamares. See the branding file for
   more documentation. In particular, the setting *windowExpanding*
   can be set to *normal*, *fullscreen* or *noexpand*.
 * The `settings.conf` file can now configure whether the *Cancel* button
   is shown (this isn't a branding thing, because it's quite fundamental
   to the workflow of the installer).

## Modules ##

 * The *partition* module supports RAID devices, but only when Calamares
   is compiled with the newest KPMCore release (3.3.0).
 * The calculation of required space -- including swap -- has been simplified,
   and Calamares no longer reserves 2GiB of space in calculations for internal
   use (this means that it no longer mysteriously drops swap when the disk
   size is close to the required installation size).
 * The name of the type of default filesystem (e.g. ext4 or btrfs) is now handled
   case- and localization-insensitively. This means that *btrfs* is now always
   an acceptable spelling.
 * The currently-selected disk device is remembered between manual partitioning
   and the partitioning-overview pages. (Thanks to Arnaud)
 * *partition* There is new support for partitioning layout presets.
   See `partition.conf` for documentation and details.
 * The *keyboard* module now handles the (bogus) Austrian keymap for
   the system console properly. (Thanks to Kevin)
 * The *preservefiles* module now has a mechanism for setting the permissions
   (and ownership) of preserved files. (Thanks to Scott)
 * New module *fsresizer* can be used to resize filesystems. It is intended
   for use in OEM installs where an image of fixed size is created,
   and then sized to the actual SD card the user has used.
 * The *mount* module now handles missing *extraMounts* and *extraMountsEfi*
   keys gracefully (this is probably a misconfiguration, though, and gives a
   warning).
 * The *packages* module now supports pre- and post-script options
   for all operations, not just during install (keep in mind that
   these run as three separate shells, though).
 * A new *rawfs* module supports straightforward copying of filesystems from
   the installation media to the target stystem. This can be used, for instance,
   for block-level-identical installations.


# 3.2.3 (2019-01-09) #

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):
 - aliveafter1000

## Core ##

There are no core changes in this release.

## Modules ##

 * *partition* Fixed bug where, during detection of existing systems, the
   existing system partitions may be mounted and then files deleted.
   This is a **limited** version of the patch from aliveafter1000
   that will be in 3.2.4, which tries harder to mount filesystems
   read-only and unmodifiable.
 * *locale* It was possible to set the installer and system language
   (e.g. to German) while the global storage value for *locale*
   remained set to English. Then no localization packages are installed
   (see feature `${LOCALE}` in `packages.conf`). Reported downstream
   in Netrunner.

## Core ##

 * Example configurations are **no longer installed** by default.
   The default setting for *INSTALL_CONFIG* has changed. Distributions
   are strongly encouraged to write their own configuration files and
   not rely on the example configuration files. Example configurations
   may change unpredictably.
 * It is now possible to express module dependencies through the
   *requiredModules* key in `module.desc`. All of the required modules
   for a given module must occur in the sequence **before** the module
   requiring them. None of the core modules use this facility.
 * The search paths for QML files, branding descriptors and module
   descriptors have been revamped and now self-document in the log.
 * A new `ci/RELEASE.sh` script has been added to streamline releases;
   it is not guaranteed to work anywhere in particular though.

## Modules ##

 * When multiple modules are mutually exclusive, or don't make sense
   to enable concurrectly, a new `USE_<foo>` framework has been added
   to CMake to simplify the selection of modules. This is in addition
   to the existing `SKIP_MODULES` mechanism.
 * Various off-by-one-sector errors in the automatic partitioning
   mode have been corrected. In addition, swap space is calculated
   a little more conservatively.
 * A new module has been added to the core which can configure openrc
   services. To make services configuration consistent:
   - The *services* module has been **renamed** *services-systemd*,
   - The openrc module is named *services-openrc*,
   - At CMake time, it is possible to select all of the services modules,
     or one specific one, by setting the *USE_services* CMake variable.
     By default, all of the modules are built and installed.
 * The systemd-services module can now disable targets and mask both
   targets and services (which will allow you to break the system with
   a bad configuration). The configuration is a little more flexible
   because a service (or target) name can be used on its own with
   sensible defaults.
 * The displaymanager module has been entirely revamped. A long-standing
   bug which ignored the settings for default desktop has been fixed
   (thanks to Walter Lapchynski). Translations have been added to the
   error messages. Each DM now has an implementation class for doing
   all the configuration steps it needs. This groups the code needed for
   a specific DM (and presumably, per-distro) in one place.
   Distro's are **strongly advised** to re-test their DM configuration
   and installation with the revamped code.

# 3.2.1 (2018-06-25) #

This release contains contributions from (alphabetically by first name):

## Core ##

 * Qt 5.7 is now the minimum required Qt version. Because KPMCore
   (a fairly fundamental dependency) requires Qt 5.7, Calamares
   has followed suit.
 * New testing application `loadmodule` for loading and running a
   single Calamares module.
 * New translations Belarussian and Korean.
 * Jobs can now be *emergency jobs* which run even after a failure.
 * Improved debugging when modules fail to load.
 * Bad configuration files will now cause the user-interface of
   Calamares to display an error message, rather than silently
   ignoring some configuration errors. This will certainly cause
   problems for distributions with sloppy configurations.

## Modules ##

 * New module preservefiles, keeps (log) files around after install;
   this duplicates functionality with the unmount module, but unmount
   is very late, rather limited, and fragile.
 * Interactiveterminal module now disables itself if build requirements
   are not met, rather than blocking the build.
 * Fixes in the timezone map data make the southern hemisphere more
   usable and put Reykjavik in its place.
 * The packages module can now update the target system if explicitly
   told to do so.
 * More paths and executables are configurable in the bootloader module.
 * Distributions are advised to review the `users.conf` setup **again**,
   as some changes in version 3.2.0 caused regressions downstream.
 * Distributions are advised to review their `locale.gen` files
   **again**. Previous changes were too restrictive, matching only
   the specific format Chakra Linux uses. Calamares now preserves
   all the comment-lines in the file and writes enabled locales
   at the end, with a descriptive comment.

# 3.2.0 (2018-05-17) #

## Modules ##

 * UI annoyances in the partitioning module were fixed; the
   mount-point selector is now more obvious when no mount-point
   has been chosen, and the mount-point and flags are preserved
   when (re)editing partitions.
 * The handling of `@@ROOT@@` substitution in shellprocesses was
   backwards; this has been fixed (the substitution is made when
   running in the **host**).
 * The user shell is no longer hard-coded to `/bin/bash`,
   but follows the default setting for useradd(8), e.g.
   those set in `/etc/default/useradd`.
