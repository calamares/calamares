# Support macros for creating Calamares branding components.
#
# Calamares branding components have two parts:
# - a branding.desc file that tells Calamares how to describe the product
#   (e.g. strings like "Generic GNU/Linux") and the name of a QML file
#   (the "slideshow") that is displayed during installation.
# - the QML files themselves, plus supporting images etc.
#
# Branding components can be created inside the Calamares source tree
# (there is one example the `default/` branding, which is also connected
# to the default configuration shipped with Calamares), but they can be
# built outside of, and largely independently of, Calamares by using
# these CMake macros.
#
# See the calamares-examples repository for more examples.

# Usage calamares_add_branding( <name> [DIRECTORY <dir>] [SUBDIRECTORIES <dir> ...])
#
# Adds a branding component to the build:
# - the component's top-level files are copied into the build-dir;
#   CMakeLists.txt is excluded from the glob.
# - the component's top-level files are installed into the component branding dir
#
# The branding component lives in <dir> if given, otherwise the
# current source directory. The branding component is installed
# with the given <name>, which is usually the name of the
# directory containing the component, and which must match the
# *componentName* in `branding.desc`.
#
# If SUBDIRECTORIES are given, then those are copied (each one level deep)
# to the installation location as well, preserving the subdirectory name.
