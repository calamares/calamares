# Selectable filesystem type, used when "erase" is done.
#
# When erasing the disk, the *defaultFileSystemType* is used (see
# above), but it is also possible to give users a choice:
# list suitable filesystems here. A drop-down is provided
# to pick which is the filesystems will be used.
#
# The value *defaultFileSystemType* is added to this list (with a warning)
# if not present; the default pick is the *defaultFileSystemType*.
#
# If not specified at all, uses *defaultFileSystemType* without a
# warning (this matches traditional no-choice-available behavior best).
