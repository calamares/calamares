# Configuration for the one-user-system user module.
#
# Besides these settings, the user module also places the following
# keys into the globalconfig area, based on user input in the view step.
#
# - hostname
# - username
# - password (obscured)
# - autologinUser (if enabled, set to username)
#
# These globalconfig keys are set when the jobs for this module
# are created.

# Used as default groups for the created user.
# Adjust to your Distribution defaults.
defaultGroups:
    - users
    - lp
    - video
    - network
    - storage
    - wheel
    - audio

# Some Distributions require a 'autologin' group for the user.
# Autologin causes a user to become automatically logged in to
# the desktop environment on boot.
# Disable when your Distribution does not require such a group.
autologinGroup:  autologin
# You can control the initial state for the 'autologin checkbox' in UsersViewStep here.
# Possible values are: true to enable or false to disable the checkbox by default
doAutologin:     true

# When set to a non-empty string, Calamares creates a sudoers file for the user.
#  /etc/sudoers.d/10-installer
# Remember to add sudoersGroup to defaultGroups.
#
# If your Distribution already sets up a group of sudoers in its packaging,
# remove this setting (delete or comment out the line below). Otherwise,
# the setting will be duplicated in the /etc/sudoers.d/10-installer file,
# potentially confusing users.
sudoersGroup:    wheel

# Setting this to false , causes the root account to be disabled.
setRootPassword: true
# You can control the initial state for the 'root password checkbox' in UsersViewStep here.
# Possible values are: true to enable or false to disable the checkbox by default.
# When enabled the user password is used for the root account too.
# NOTE: doReusePassword requires setRootPassword to be enabled.
doReusePassword: true

# These are optional password-requirements that a distro can enforce
# on the user. The values given in this sample file disable each check,
# as if the check was not listed at all.
passwordRequirements:
    minLength: -1  # Password at least this many characters
    maxLength: -1  # Password at most this many characters

userShell: /bin/bash
