calamares \- distribution-independent system installer 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B calamares
[\fI\,options\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B calamares
is a distribution-independent system installer, with an advanced partitioning 
feature for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the 
first installer with an automated “Replace Partition” option, which makes it 
easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing. Calamares is 
designed to be customizable by distribution maintainers without need for 
cumbersome patching, thanks to third party branding and external modules 
support.
