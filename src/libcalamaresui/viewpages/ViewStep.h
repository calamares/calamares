/**
 * @brief The ViewStep class is the base class for all view modules.
 * A view module is a Calamares module which has at least one UI page (exposed as
 * ViewStep::widget), and can optionally create Calamares jobs at runtime.
 * As of early 2020, a view module can be implemented by deriving from ViewStep
 * in C++ (as a Qt Plugin or a Qml ViewStep) or in Python with the PythonQt interface
 * (which also mimics the ViewStep class).
 *
 * A ViewStep can describe itself in human-readable format for the SummaryPage
 * (which shows all of the things which have been collected to be done in the
 * next exec-step) through prettyStatus() and createSummaryWidget().
