# Run mkinitcpio(8) with the given preset value

kernel: linux

# For some ISO's (e.g. with archiso generated ISO's) the squashfs image doesn't
# contain a kernel image file. Therefore, the kernel image file needs to be
# copied to the corresponding target. For this, the source and the target path
# can be specified with the configuration parameters image_source and
# image_target.
#
# Both parameters are optional. If image_source is not set, the system assumes
# that the squashfs image already contains a kernel image file, and image_target
# is ignored (if it is set).
# If image_source is set, the kernel image is copied to the target specified
# with image_target. If image_target is not set, /boot/vmlinuz-linux is
# assumed to be the target path of the image. The image_target needs to be
# consistent with the kernel image path in the mkinitcpio preset.
#
# For ISO's generated with archiso, the following configuration is needed:
#
# image_source: /run/archiso/bootmnt/arch/boot/x86_64/vmlinuz
