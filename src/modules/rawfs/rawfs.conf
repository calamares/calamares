# Configuration for the rawfs module: raw filesystem copy to a block device

---

# To apply a custom partition layout, it has to be defined as a list of targets.
#
# For each target, the following attributes must be defined:
#       * mountPoint: The mount point of the destination device on the installed system
#         The corresponding block device will automatically be identified and used as the
#         destination for the operation
#       * source: The source filesystem; it can be the mount point of a locally (on the
#         live system) mounted filesystem, a path to a disk image, or a block device
#       * resize (optional): Expand the destination filesystem to fill the whole
#         partition at the end of the operation; this works only with ext filesystems
#         for now

targets:
    - mountPoint: /
      source: /
    - mountPoint: /home
      source: /images/home.img
      resize: true
    - mountPoint: /data
      source: /dev/mmcblk0p3

# To support testing, set the *bogus* key to true. No actual work is done, but the
# module's logic is exercised.

# bogus: false
