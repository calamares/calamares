# This setting specifies the mount point of the EFI system partition. Some
# distributions (Fedora, Debian, Manjaro, etc.) use /boot/efi, others (KaOS,

# In autogenerated partitioning, allow the user to select a swap size?
# If there is exactly one choice, no UI is presented, and the user
# cannot make a choice -- this setting is used. If there is more than
# one choice, a UI is presented.
#
# Legacy settings *neverCreateSwap* and *ensureSuspendToDisk* correspond
# to values of *userSwapChoices* as follows:
#    - *neverCreateSwap* is true, means [none]
#    - *neverCreateSwap* is false, *ensureSuspendToDisk* is false, [small]
#    - *neverCreateSwap* is false, *ensureSuspendToDisk* is true, [suspend]
#
# Autogenerated swap sizes are as follows:
#    - *suspend*: Swap is always at least total memory size,
#      and up to 4GiB RAM follows the rule-of-thumb 2 * memory;
#      from 4GiB to 8 GiB it stays steady at 8GiB, and over 8 GiB memory
#      swap is the size of main memory.
#    - *small*: Follows the rules above, but Swap is at
#      most 8GiB, and no more than 10% of available disk.
# In both cases, a fudge factor (usually 10% extra) is applied so that there
# is some space for administrative overhead (e.g. 8 GiB swap will allocate
# 8.8GiB on disk in the end).
userSwapChoices:
    - none      # Create no swap, use no swap
    - reuse     # Re-use existing swap, but don't create any (unsupported right now)
    - small     # Up to 4GB
    - suspend   # At least main memory size
    - file      # To swap file instead of partition (unsupported right now)

# LEGACY SETTINGS (these will generate a warning)
# ensureSuspendToDisk:    true
# neverCreateSwap:        false

# Correctly draw nested (e.g. logical) partitions as such.

# Default filesystem type, used when a "new" partition is made.
#
# When replacing a partition, the existing filesystem inside the
# partition is retained. In other cases, e.g. Erase and Alongside,
# as well as when using manual partitioning and creating a new
# partition, this filesystem type is pre-selected. Note that
# editing a partition in manual-creation mode will not automatically
# change the filesystem type to this default value -- it is not
# creating a new partition.
#
# Suggested values: ext2, ext3, ext4, reiser, xfs, jfs, btrfs
# If nothing is specified, Calamares defaults to "ext4".

# Show/hide LUKS related functionality in automated partitioning modes.

#
# BIG FAT WARNING:
#
# This option is unsupported, as it cuts out a crucial security feature.
# Disabling LUKS and shipping Calamares without a correctly configured GRUB2
# and initramfs is considered suboptimal use of the Calamares software. The
# Calamares team will not provide user support for any potential issue that
# may arise as a consequence of setting this option to false.
# It is strongly recommended that system integrators put in the work to support
# LUKS unlocking support in GRUB2 and initramfs/dracut/mkinitcpio/etc.
# Support is offered to system integrators that wish to do so, through the
# Calamares bug tracker, as well as in #calamares on Freenode.
# For more information on setting up GRUB2 for Calamares with LUKS, see
