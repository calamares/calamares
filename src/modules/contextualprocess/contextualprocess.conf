# Configuration for the contextual process job.
#
# Contextual processes are based on **global** configuration values.
# When a given global value (string) equals a given value, then
# the associated command is executed.
#
# The special top-level keys *dontChroot* and *timeout* have
# meaning just like in shellprocess.conf. They are excluded from
# the comparison with global variables.
#
# Configuration consists of keys for global variable names (except
# *dontChroot* and *timeout*), and the sub-keys are strings to compare
# to the variable's value. If the variable has that particular value, the
# corresponding value (script) is executed.
#
# You can check for an empty value with "".
#
# As a special case, the value-check "*" matches any value, but **only**
# if no other value-check matches. Use it as an *else* form for value-
# checks. Take care to put the asterisk in quotes.
#
# Global configuration variables are not checked in a deterministic
# order, so do not rely on commands from one variable-check to
# always happen before (or after) checks on another
# variable. Similarly, the value-equality checks are not
# done in a deterministic order, but all of the value-checks
# for a given variable happen together. As a special case, the
# value-check for "*" (the *else* case) happens after all of the
# other value-checks, and only matches if none of the others do.
#
# The values after a value sub-keys are the same kinds of values
# as can be given to the *script* key in the shellprocess module.
# See shellprocess.conf for documentation on valid values.
