# Creates /etc/fstab and /etc/crypttab in the target system.
# Also creates mount points for all the filesystems.

# When creating fstab entries for a filesystem, this module

# Mount options to use for all filesystems. If a specific filesystem
# is listed here, use those options, otherwise use the *default*
# options from this mapping.
mountOptions:
    default: defaults,noatime
    btrfs: defaults,noatime,space_cache,autodefrag

# Mount options to use for the EFI System Partition. If not defined, the
# *mountOptions* for *vfat* are used, or if that is not set either,
# *default* from *mountOptions*.
efiMountOptions: umask=0077

# If a filesystem is on an SSD, add the following options. If a specific
# filesystem is listed here, use those options, otherwise no additional
# options are set (i.e. there is no *default* like in *mountOptions*).
#
# This example configuration applies the *discard* option to most
# common filesystems on an SSD. This may not be the right option
# for your distribution. If you use a systemd timer to trim the
# SSD, it may interfere with the *discard* option. Opinions vary
# as to whether *discard* is worth the effort -- it depends on
# the usage pattern of the disk as well.
#
# ssdExtraMountOptions:
#     ext4: discard
#     jfs: discard
#     xfs: discard
#     swap: discard
#     btrfs: discard,compress=lzo
#
# The standard configuration applies only lzo compression to btrfs
# and does nothing for other filesystems.
ssdExtraMountOptions:
    btrfs: compress=lzo

# Additional options added to each line in /etc/crypttab
crypttabOptions: luks
# For Debian and Debian-based distributions, change the above line to:
