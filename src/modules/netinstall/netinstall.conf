### Netinstall module
#
# The netinstall module allows distribution maintainers to ship minimal ISOs
# with only a basic set of preinstalled packages. At installation time, the
# user is presented with the choice to install groups of packages from a
# predefined list.
#
# Calamares will then use the *packages* module to install the packages.
# Without a *packages* module in the exec phase somewhere **after**
# this netinstall, nothing will actually get installed. The packages
# module must be correctly configured **and** the package manager must
# be runnable from within the installed system at the point where it
# is invoked, otherwise you'll get nothing.
#
# There are two basic deployment schemes:
#  - static package lists; the packages do not change for this release.
#    In this case, the package list file may be on the ISO-image itself
#    as a separate file, **or** included in this configuration file.
#    Either will do; separate file is easier to update independently
#    of the Calamares configuration, while merged configurations use
#    fewer files overall and are closer to self-documenting.
#  - online package lists; the package list is fetched from a remote
#    URL and handled otherwise like a static list. This can be useful
#    if the package list needs updating during the lifetime of an ISO-
#    image, e.g. packages are added or renamed.
#
# There is only one required key for this module, *groupsUrl*.
#
# This module supports multiple instances through the *label* key,
# which allows you to distinguish them in the UI.
---
# The *groupsUrl* determines where the data for the netinstall groups-and-
# packages comes from. The value of the key may be:
#
# - a single string (this is treated as a list with just that string in it)
# - a list of strings
#
# Each string is treated as a URL (see below for special cases. The
# list is examined **in order** and each URL is tried in turn. The
# first URL to load successfully -- even if it yields 0 packages --
# ends the process. This allows using a network URL and a (fallback)
# local URL for package lists, or for using multiple mirrors of
# netinstall data.
#
# The URL must point to a YAML file that follows the format described
# below at the key *groups* -- except for the special case URL "local".
# Note that the contents of the groups file is the **important**
# part of the configuration of this module. It specifies what
# groups and packages the user may select (and so what commands are to
# be run to install them).
#
# The format of the groups file is the same as the format of the
# *groups* key described below, **except** that a stand-alone
# groups file does not have to have the top-level *groups* key.
# (It **may** have one, though, for instance when you copy
# this configuration file to `netinstall.yaml` and key *groups*
# must have a list-of-groups as value; if the file does not have
# a top-level key *groups*, then the file must contain only a list of groups.
#
# Each item in the list *groupsUrl* may be:
# - A remote URL like `http://example.org/netinstall.php`
# - A local file URL like `file:///usr/share/calamares/netinstall.yaml`
# - The special-case literal string `local`
#
# Non-special case URLs are loaded as YAML; if the load succeeds, then
# they are interpreted like the *groups* key below. The special case
# `local` loads the data directly from **this** file.
#
groupsUrl: local

# Alternate form:
# groupsUrl: [ local ]

# Net-based package list, with fallback to local file
# groupsUrl:
#   - http://example.com/calamares/netinstall.yaml
#   - file:///etc/calamares/modules/netinstall.yaml



# If the installation can proceed without netinstall (e.g. the Live CD
# can create a working installed system, but netinstall is preferred
# to bring it up-to-date or extend functionality) leave this set to
# false (the default). If set to true, the netinstall data is required.
#
# This only has an effect if the netinstall data cannot be retrieved,
# or is corrupt: having "required" set, means the install cannot proceed.
# For local or file: type *groupsUrl* settings, this setting is not
# really meaningful.
required: false

# To support multiple instances of this module,
# some strings are configurable and translatable here.
# Sub-keys under *label* are used for the user interface.
#  - *sidebar* This is the name of the module in the progress-tree / sidebar
#   in Calamares.
#  - *title* This is displayed above the list of packages.
# If no *sidebar* values are provided, defaults to "Package selection"
# and existing translations. If no *title* values are provided, no string
# is displayed.
#
# Translations are handled through `[ll]` notation, much like in
# `.desktop` files. The string associated with `key[ll]` is used for
# *key* when when the language *ll* (language-code, like *nl* or *en_GB*
# or *ja*) is used.
#
# The following strings are **already** known to Calamares and can be
# listed here in *untranslated* form (e.g. as value of *sidebar*)
# without bothering with the translations: they are picked up from
# the regular translation framework:
#  - "Package selection"
#  - "Office software"
#  - "Office package"
#  - "Browser software"
#  - "Browser package"
#  - "Web browser"
#  - "Kernel"
#  - "Services"
#  - "Login"
#  - "Desktop"
#  - "Applications"
#  - "Communication"
#  - "Development"
#  - "Office"
#  - "Multimedia"
#  - "Internet"
#  - "Theming"
#  - "Gaming"
#  - "Utilities"
# Other strings should follow the translations format.
label:
    sidebar: "Package selection"
    # sidebar[nl]: "Pakketkeuze"
    # sidebar[en_GB]: "Package choice"
    # sidebar[ja]: "知りません"  # "I don't know"
    # title: "Office Package"
    # title[nl]: "Kantoorsoftware"

# If, and only if, *groupsUrl* is set to the literal string `local`,
# groups data is read from this file. The value of *groups* must be
# a list. Each item in the list is a group (of packages, or subgroups,
# or both). A standalone groups file contains just the list,
# (without the top-level *groups* key, or just the top-level *groups*
# key and with the list as its value, like in this file).
#
# Using `local` is recommended only for small static package lists.
# Here it is used for documentation purposes.
#
#
### Groups Format
#
# Each item in the list describes one group. The following keys are
# required for each group:
#
#  - *name* of the group; short and human-readable. Shown in the first
#    column of the UI.
#  - *description* of the group; longer and human-readable. Shown in the
#    second column of the UI. This is one of the things that visually
#    distinguishes groups (with descriptions) from packages (without).
#  - *packages*, a list of packages that belong to this group.
#    The items of the *packages* list are actual package names
#    as passed to the package manager (e.g. `qt5-creator-dev`).
#    This list may be empty (e.g. if your group contains only
#    subgroups). This key isn't **really** required, either --
#    one of *subgroups* or *packages* is.
#
# The following keys are **optional** for a group:
#
#  - *hidden*: if true, do not show the group on the page. Defaults to false.
#  - *selected*: if true, display the group as selected. Defaults to the
#    parent group's value, if there is a parent group; top-level groups
#    are set to true by default.
#  - *critical*: if true, make the installation process fail if installing
#    any of the packages in the group fails. Otherwise, just log a warning.
#    Defaults to false. If not set in a subgroup (see below), inherits from
#    the parent group.
#  - *immutable*: if true, the state of the group (and all its subgroups)
#    cannot be changed; no packages can be selected or deselected. No
#    checkboxes are show for the group. Setting *immutable* to true
#    really only makes sense in combination with *selected* set to true,
#    so that the packages will be installed. (Setting a group to immutable
#    can be seen as removing it from the user-interface.)
#  - *noncheckable*: if true, the entire group cannot be selected or
#    deselected by a single click. This does not affect any subgroups 
#    or child packages 
#  - *expanded*: if true, the group is shown in an expanded form (that is,
#    not-collapsed) in the treeview on start. This only affects the user-
#    interface. Only top-level groups are show expanded-initially.
#  - *subgroups*: if present this follows the same structure as the top level
#    groups, allowing sub-groups of packages to an arbitary depth.
#  - *pre-install*: an optional command to run within the new system before
#    the group's packages are installed. It will run before **each** package in
#    the group is installed.
#  - *post-install*: an optional command to run within the new system after
#    the group's packages are installed. It will run after **each** package in
#    the group is installed.
#
# If you set both *hidden* and *selected* for a top-level group, you are
# creating a "default" group of packages which will always be installed
# in the user's system. Hidden selected subgroups are installed if their
# parent is selected. Setting *hidden* to true without *selected*, or with
# *selected* set to false, is kind of pointless and will generate a warning.
#
# The *pre-install* and *post-install* commands are **not** passed to
# a shell; see the **packages** module configuration (i.e. `packages.conf`)
# for details. To use a full shell pipeline, call the shell explicitly.
#
# Non-critical groups are installed by calling the package manager
# individually, once for each package (and ignoring errors), while
# critical packages are installed in one single call to the package
# manager (and errors cause the installation to terminate).
#
#
#
# The *groups* key below contains some common patterns for packages
# and sub-groups, with documentation.


groups:
    # This group is hidden, so the name and description are not really
    # important. Since it is selected, these packages will be installed.
    # It's non-critical, so they are installed one-by-one.

    # This is a good approach for something you want up-to-date installed
    # in the target system every time.

    # the subgroups sets *selected* to true, the overall state of
    # **this** group is partly-selected.
    #
    # Each of the sub-groups lists a bunch of packages that can
    # be individually selected, so a user can pick (for instance)
    # just one of the ZSH packages if they like.

    # The "bare" package names can be intimidating, so you can use subgroups
    # to provide human-readable names while hiding the packages themselves.
    # This also allows you you group related packages -- suppose you feel
    # that KDevelop should be installed always with PHP and Python support,
    # but that support is split into multiple packages.
    #
    # So this subgroup (IDE) contains subgroups, one for each "package"
    # we want to install. Each of those subgroups (Emacs, KDevelop)
    # in turn contains **one** bogus subgroup, which then has the list
    # of relevant packages. This extra-level-of-subgrouping allows us
    # to list packages, while giving human-readable names.
    #
    # The name of the internal subgroup doesn't matter -- it is hidden
    # from the user -- so we can give them all bogus names and
    # descriptions, even the same name. Here, we use "Bogus". You
    # can re-use the subgroup name, it doesn't really matter.
    #
    # Each internal subgroup is set to *hidden*, so it does not show up
    # as an entry in the list, and it is set to *selected*,
    # so that if you select its parent subgroup, the packages from
    # the subgroup are selected with it and get installed.
