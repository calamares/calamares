#The DM module attempts to set up all the DMs found in this list, in that precise order.
#It also sets up autologin, if the feature is enabled in globalstorage.
#The displaymanagers list can also be set in globalstorage, and in that case it overrides anything set up here.
displaymanagers:
  - slim
  - sddm
  - lightdm
  - gdm
  - mdm
  - lxdm
  - kdm

#Enable the following settings to force a desktop environment in your displaymanager configuration file:
#defaultDesktopEnvironment:
#    executable: "startkde"
#    desktopFile: "plasma"

#If true, try to ensure that the user, group, /var directory etc. for the
#display manager are set up correctly. This is normally done by the distribution
#packages, and best left to them. Therefore, it is disabled by default.
