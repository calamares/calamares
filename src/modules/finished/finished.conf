Configuration for the "finished" page, which is usually shown only at
the end of the installation (successful or not).

# The finished page can hold a "restart system now" checkbox.
# If this is false, no checkbox is show and the system is not restarted
# when Calamares exits.
restartNowEnabled: true
# Initial state of the checkbox "restart now".
restartNowChecked: false
# If the checkbox is shown, and the checkbox is checked, then when
# Calamares exits from the finished-page it will run this command.
restartNowCommand: "systemctl -i reboot"

# When the last page is (successfully) reached, send a DBus notification
# to the desktop that the installation is done. This works only if the
# user as whom Calamares is run, can reach the regular desktop session bus.
