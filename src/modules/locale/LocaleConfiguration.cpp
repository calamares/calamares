    /*  # It is relatively common for the combination of language and location (as
        # selected on the timezone page) not to identify a supported combined
        # locale.  For example, this happens when the user is a migrant, or when
        # they prefer to use a different language to interact with their computer
        # because that language is better-supported.
        #
        # In such cases, we would like to be able to use a locale reflecting the
        # selected language in LANG for messages, character types, and collation,
        # and to make the other locale categories reflect the selected location.
        # This means that we have to guess at a suitable locale for the selected
        # location, and we do not want to ask yet another locale-related question.
        # Nevertheless, some cases are ambiguous: a user who has asked for the
        # English language and identifies their location as Switzerland will get
        # different numeric representation depending on which Swiss locale we pick.
        #
        # The goal of identifying a reasonable default for migrants makes things
        # easier: it is reasonable to default to French for France despite the
        # existence of several minority languages there, because anyone who prefers
        # those languages will probably already have selected them and won't arrive
        # here.  However, in some cases we're unsure, and in some cases we actively
        # don't want to pick a "preferred" language: selecting either Greek or
        # Turkish as the default language for migrants to Cyprus would probably
        # offend somebody!  In such cases we simply punt to the old behaviour of not
        # setting up a locale reflecting the location, which is suboptimal but is at
        # least unlikely to give offence.
        #
        # Our best shot at general criteria for selecting a default language in
        # these circumstances are as follows:
        #
        #  * Exclude special-purpose (e.g. en_DK) and artificial (e.g. la_AU,
        #    tlh_GB) locales.
        #  * If there is a language specific to or very strongly associated with the
        #    country in question, prefer it unless it has rather few native
        #    speakers.
        #  * Exclude minority languages that are relatively unlikely to be spoken by
        #    migrants who have not already selected them as their preferred language
        #    earlier in the installer.
        #  * If there is an official national language likely to be seen in print
        #    media, road signs, etc., then prefer that.
        #  * In cases of doubt, selecting no default language is safe. */
