# Create, overwrite or update /etc/default/grub in the target system.

# Write lines to /etc/default/grub (in the target system) based
# on calculated values and the values set in the *defaults* key
# in this configuration file.
#
# Calculated values are:
#   - GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR,   branding module, *bootloaderEntryName* (this
#     string is sanitized, and see also setting *keep_distributor*)
#   - GRUB_ENABLE_CRYPTODISK, based on the presence of filesystems
#     that use LUKS
#   - GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, adding LUKS setup and plymouth
#     support to the kernel.

# already existed. If set to false, edits the existing file instead.

# If set to true, prefer to write files in /etc/default/grub.d/
