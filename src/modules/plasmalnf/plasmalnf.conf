# The Plasma Look-and-Feel module allows selecting a Plasma
# Look-and-Feel in the live- or host-system and switches the
# host Plasma session immediately to the chosen LnF; it
# can also write a LnF configuration to the target user / on
# the target system.
#
# This module should be used once in a view section (to get
# the UI) and once in the exec section (to apply the selection
# to the target user). It should come **after** the user module
# in exec, so that the target user has been created alrady.
---
# Full path to the Plasma look-and-feel tool (CLI program
# for querying and applying Plasma themes). If this is not
# set, no LNF setting will happen.
lnftool:	"/usr/bin/lookandfeeltool"

# For systems where the user Calamares runs as (usually root,
# via either sudo or pkexec) has a clean environment, set this
# to the originating username; the lnftool will be run through
# "sudo -H -u <liveuser>" instead of directly.
#
# liveuser:	"live"

# If *showAll* is true, then all installed themes are shown in the
# UI for selection, even if they are not listed in *themes* (below).
# This allows selection of all themes even while not all of them are
# listed in *themes* -- which is useful to show screenshots for those
# you do have a screenshot for. If *themes* is empty or missing,
# the value of *showAll* is treated as `true`.
showAll: false

# You can limit the list of Plasma look-and-feel themes by listing ids
# here. If this key is not present, all of the installed themes are listed.
# If the key is present, only installed themes that are **also** included
# in the list are shown (could be none!). See the *showAll* key, above,
# to change that.
#
# Themes may be listed by id, (e.g. fluffy-bunny, below) or as a theme
# and an image (e.g. breeze) which will be used to show a screenshot.
# Themes with no image set at all get a "missing screenshot" image; if the
# image file is not found, they get a color swatch based on the image name.
#
# The image may be an absolute path. If it is a relative path, though,
# it is searched in the current directory and in the branding directory
# (i.e. relative to the directory where your branding.desc lives).
#
# Valid forms of entries in the *themes* key:
#  - A single string (unquoted), which is the theme id
#  - A pair of *theme* and *image* keys, e.g.
#    ```
#    - theme: fluffy-bunny.desktop
#      image: "fluffy-screenshot.png"
#    ```
#
# The image screenshot is resized to 12x8 the current font size, with
# a minimum of 120x80 pixels. This allows the screenshot to scale up
# on HiDPI displays where the fonts are larger (in pixels).
themes:
    - org.kde.fuzzy-pig.desktop
    - theme: org.kde.breeze.desktop
      image: "breeze.png"
    - theme: org.kde.breezedark.desktop
      image: "breeze-dark.png"
    - org.kde.fluffy-bunny.desktop

# You can pre-select one of the themes; it is not applied
# immediately, but its radio-button is switched on to indicate
# that that is the theme (that is most likely) currently in use.
# Do this only on Live images where you are reasonably sure
# that the user is not going to change the theme out from under
# themselves before running the installer.
#
# If this key is present, its value should be the id of the theme
# which should be pre-selected. If absent, empty, or the pre-selected
# theme is not found on the live system, no theme will be pre-selected.
#
# As a special setting, use "*", to try to find the currently-
# selected theme by reading the Plasma configuration. This requires
# KF5::Config at build- and run-time.
preselect: "*"
