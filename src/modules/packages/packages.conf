# Often package installation needs an internet connection.
# Since you may allow system installation without a connection
# and want to offer **optional** package installation, it's
# possible to have no internet, yet have this packages module
# enabled in settings.
#
# You can skip the whole module when there is no internet
# by setting *skip_if_no_internet* to true.
#
# You can run a package-manager specific update procedure
# before installing packages (for instance, to update the
# list of packages and dependencies); this is done only if there
# is an internet connection. Set *update_db* to true to do so.
skip_if_no_internet: false
update_db: true

#
# List of maps with package operations such as install or remove.
# Distro developers can provide a list of packages to remove
# from the installed system (for instance packages meant only
# for the live system).
#
# A job implementing a distro specific logic to determine other
# packages that need to be installed or removed can run before
# this one. Distro developers may want to install locale packages
# or remove drivers not needed on the installed system.
# Such a job would populate a list of dictionaries in the global
# storage called "packageOperations" and that list is processed
# after the static list in the job configuration (i.e. the list
# that is in this configuration file).
#
# Allowed package operations are:
#  - install, try_install: will call the package manager to
#       install one or more packages. The install target will
#       abort the whole installation if package-installation
#       fails, while try_install carries on. Packages may be
#       listed as (localized) names, or as (localized) package-data.
#       See below for the description of the format.
# - localInstall: this is used to call the package manager
#       to install a package from a path-to-a-package. This is
#       useful if you have a static package archive on the install media.
# - remove, try_remove: will call the package manager to
#       remove one or more packages. The remove target will
#       abort the whole installation if package-removal fails,
#       while try_remove carries on. Packages may be listed as
#       (localized) names.
#
# There are two formats for naming packages: as a name or as package-data,
# which is an object notation providing package-name, as well as pre- and
# post-install scripts.
#
# Here are both formats, for installing vi. The first one just names the
# package for vi (using the naming of the installed package manager), while
# the second contains three data-items; the pre-script is run before invoking
# the package manager, and the post-script runs once it is done.
#
# - install
#   - vi
#   - package: vi
#     pre-script: touch /tmp/installing-vi
#     post-script: rm -f /tmp/installing-vi
#
# The pre- and post-scripts are optional, but you cannot leave both out: using
# "package: vi" with neither script option will trick Calamares into
# trying to install a package named "package: vi", which is unlikely to work.
#
# Any package name may be localized; this is used to install localization
# packages for software based on the selected system locale. By including
# the string LOCALE in the package name, the following happens:
#
# - if the system locale is English (any variety), then the package is not
#   installed at all,
# - otherwise $LOCALE or ${LOCALE} is replaced by the **lower-cased** BCP47
#   name of the **language** part of the selected system locale (not the
#   country/region/dialect part), e.g. selecting *nl_BE* will use *nl*
#   here.
#
# Take care that just plain LOCALE will not be replaced, so foo-LOCALE will
# be left unchanged, while foo-$LOCALE will be changed. However, foo-LOCALE
# **will** be removed from the list of packages, if English is selected.
#
# The following installs localizations for vi, if they are relevant; if
# there is no localization, installation continues normally.
#
# - install
#   - vi-$LOCALE
#   - package: vi-${LOCALE}
#     pre-script: touch /tmp/installing-vi
#     post-script: rm -f /tmp/installing-vi
#
# When installing packages, Calamares will invoke the package manager
# with a list of package names if it can; package-data prevents this because
# of the scripts that need to run. In other words, this:
#
# - install:
#   - vi
#   - binutils
#   - package: wget
#     pre-script: touch /tmp/installing-wget
#
# This will invoke the package manager three times, once for each package,
# because not all of them are simple package names. You can speed up the
# process if you have only a few pre-scriots, by using multiple install targets:
#
# - install:
#   - vi
#   - binutils
# - install:
#   - package: wget
#     pre-script: touch /tmp/installing-wget
#
# This will call the package manager once with the package-names "vi" and
# "binutils", and then a second time for "wget". When installing large numbers
# of packages, this can lead to a considerable time savings.
#
operations:
  - install:
    - vi
    - vi-${LOCALE}
    - wget
    - binutils
  - remove:
    - vi
    - wget
    - binutils
