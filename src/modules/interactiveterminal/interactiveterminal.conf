# The interactive terminal provides a konsole (terminal) window
# during the installation process. The terminal runs in the
# host system, so you will need to change directories to the
# target system to examine the state there.
#
# The one configuration key *command*, if defined, is passed
# as a command to run in the terminal window before any user
# input is accepted. The user must exit the terminal manually
# or click *next* to proceed to the next installation step.
#
# If no command is defined, no command is run and the user
# gets a plain terminal session.
