# This selects between different welcome texts. When false, uses
# the traditional "Welcome to the %1 installer.", and when true,
# uses "Welcome to the Calamares installer for %1." This allows
# to distinguish this installer from other installers for the
# same distribution.
welcomeStyleCalamares:   false

# These are strings shown to the user in the user interface.
# There is no provision for translating them -- since they
# are names, the string is included as-is.
#
# The four Url strings are the Urls used by the buttons in
# the welcome screen, and are not shown to the user. Clicking
# on the "Support" button, for instance, opens the link supportUrl.
# If a Url is empty, the corresponding button is not shown.
#
# bootloaderEntryName is how this installation / distro is named
# in the boot loader (e.g. in the GRUB menu).

# Should the welcome image (productWelcome, below) be scaled
# up beyond its natural size? If false, the image does not grow
# with the window but remains the same size throughout (this
# may have surprising effects on HiDPI monitors).
welcomeExpandingLogo:   true

# These images are loaded from the branding module directory.
#
# productIcon is used as the window icon, and will (usually) be used
#       by the window manager to represent the application. This image
#       should be square, and may be displayed by the window manager
#       as small as 16x16 (but possibly larger).
# productLogo is used as the logo at the top of the left-hand column
#       which shows the steps to be taken. The image should be square,
#       and is displayed at 80x80 pixels (also on HiDPI).
# productWelcome is shown on the welcome page of the application in
#       the middle of the window, below the welcome text. It can be
#       any size and proportion, and will be scaled to fit inside
#       the window. Use `welcomeExpandingLogo` to make it non-scaled.
#       Recommended size is 320x150.
