 * this class; its only responsibility is to load KPMCore
 * and to cleanly unload it on destruction (with KPMCore 4,
 * also to shutdown the privileged helper application).
 *
 * It loads the default plugin ("parted" with KPMCore 3, "sfdisk"
 * with KPMCore 4), but this can be overridden by setting the
 * environment variable KPMCORE_BACKEND. Setting it to
 * "dummy" will load the dummy plugin instead.
